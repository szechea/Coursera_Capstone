Fuled by the influx of immigrants in the 19th century, locals open coffee shops to satisfy the growing European working population. Later on, coffee shop owners made an equally delicious brew to the local population by using fannel \"socks\" to filter the coffee and finishing off with sugar and evaporated milk. The traditional way of coffee making is pocket friendly and among the favorites with locals today. \n\n<h4>1.2 Business problem </h4>\nThe coffee culture scene changes along with time with many new cafes - independent and chain operator marking their ground in all parts of Singapore. This bring in new challenges and competition in the coffee making industry. In this project, we will analyse the coffee shops currently available in the neighborhoods, identify the highest number of coffee shops in the neighborhood and recommend any potential neighborhood to start a coffee shop business.\n\n<h4>1.3 Target audience</h4>\n\n - Business owners that are venturing into coffee shop business\n - Business analyst that are curious about the coffee shop scene in Singapore "
